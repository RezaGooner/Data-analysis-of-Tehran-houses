   - Calculate the average price of houses in each area to identify the most and least expensive neighborhoods.

2. **How many houses are there in each area?**
   - Determine the distribution of houses across different areas of Tehran.

3. **What is the relationship between the area of a house and its price?**
   - Analyze whether larger houses tend to be more expensive.

4. **Does the number of rooms (Room Column) affect the price of a house?**
   - Investigate how the number of rooms influences the price of a property.

5. **Which area has the most expensive houses, and which area has the cheapest houses?**
   - Identify the areas with the highest and lowest average house prices.

6. **Which area has the highest number of houses with parking?**
   - Explore the availability of parking in different areas.

7. **Can you buy a two-room house or a house with parking for $250,000?**
